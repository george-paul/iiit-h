# BRED - Assignment 1

## Question 1

### Project a

##### a)

There is no difference in the way nationalistic rhetoric is used between Conservative and Liberal politics.



##### b)

~ The amount of time spent in the country. An NRI, say, would more commonly have a lower sense of patriotism and less susceptible to nationalistic narrative.

~ The ability for subjects to resist being swayed by the charisma of politicians. 



### Project b

##### a)

Music does not affect human creativity.



##### b)

~ The relevance of the music to the creative task at hand. A musician is much more likely to be inspired by music than other creatives.

## Question 2

**Research Question:** Is immigration into India easy? Analysing the nature of immigration into India, answering questions regarding what groups of people are immigrating, where in India they are settling and how they find the process. 



A mixed methods approach would be useful in this case. Quantitative methods can be used to narrow down sites of research and what questions can be asked during the qualitative methods. The mixed methods approach ensures both a higher feasibility as well as more credibility since prominent, relevant and tangible statistics can be used to support arguments made by the qualitative data.



## Question 3

### Experiment a

##### a)

**Independent Variables:** Whether a person is a member of the tribe or not. And each person's stance within the tribe.

**Dependent Variables:** Cultural, societal and daily practices, their nature and frequency etc.; The social dynamics between the members.



##### b)

- The time and season in which the study is conducted *(constant)*.
- The particular nature and personalities of the specific observed people *(random)*.
- The presence of the Dora in these interactions *(confounding)*.



##### c)

This experiment is an example of a field experiment.



##### d)

Some groups studied in the experiment could be: Those holding positions of responsibility, members of different genders, members of different age demographics.

Controlled conditions could be ensuring that the tribe members remain in their original residences and aren't disrupted too much by Dora. 

This experiment features unrelated design. No repeated measure or subjects are present.



### Experiment b

##### a)

**Independent Variables:** Whether a person takes the new formula or the old formula(placebo).

**Dependent Variables:** The ability of the subjects to complete their BRED assignment without feeling sleepy.



##### b)

- The predetermined sleep schedules of the subjects *(random)*.
- The studiousness of each student *(random)*.
- A subject's developed tolerance to drinks like Sttinger *(random)*.
- Whether it's currently exam time or not. *(constant)*



##### c)

Provided the extraneous variables can be controlled and accounted for, this is a true/controlled experiment. Else, a quasi-controlled experiment.



##### d)

Some groups that can be studied individually are: The students known to be studious, the students that regularly drink beverages like Sttinger. This is besides the two independent variable groups of those who receive the new formula and those who receive the old formula.

Controlled conditions are factors such as the amount of Sttinger consumed and at what frequency.

The study is an unrelated design since it features no repeated measures or repeated subjects.



### Experiment c

##### a)

**Independent Variables:** The amount of sleep a person has gotten.

**Dependent Variables:** A measure of their academic performance. Here, their CGPA.

##### b)

- The predisposed needs for sleep of the subjects *(random)*.
- The amount of time spent on  studies*(random, can also be confounding if one takes into account the fact that less sleep could mean more time spent studying)*.
- The extra activities of the student *(random)*.



##### c)

This is a field experiment. 



##### d)

Groups under study are those with varying levels of sleep time.

Controlled conditions are minimal. 

The design is unrelated. No repeated measures or subjects are present.



## Question 4

##### a)

This a true experiment.



##### b)

Taking this from lab to land can be done by making the different coloured cups available in a coffee shop or cafe. Following each customer's order, the waiter can push the customer for a rating or overall satisfaction with the item in the cup and if at liberty, then to rate the various specific factors as well.

*Pros:* 

~ The phenomenon can be observed in a more natural setting.

~ The customer could be more disposed to sensing the different characteristics of the beverage than the chosen sample in the experiment.

*Cons:*

~ No repetition among customers is guaranteed to occur unless a customer repeats their order.

~ The customer is under no obligation to give accurate and productive ratings.
