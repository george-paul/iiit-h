## Bayes Theorem

$$
P(F|E) = \frac{P(E|F)P(F)}{P(E)}
$$

Also proved (refer figure)

Proof of Bayes Theorem:
$$
P(F|E) = P(F\cap E)/P(E)\\
\implies P(F|E)P(E) = P(F\cap E) = P(E|F)P(E)\\
\therefore P(F|E)P(E) = P(E|F)(F)\\
\implies p(F|E) = \frac{P(F|E)P(F)}{P(E)}
$$

### Question:

* 60% of all email in 2016 is spam
* 20% of spam has the word "Dear"
* 1% of non-spam (aka ham) has the word "Dear"

You get an email with the word "Dear", what is the probability that it is spam?

#### Answer:

Events are

E: "Dear" occurs

F: "Spam" occurs

>Note: Sometimes convention is used such that E means "Evidence" and/or F means "Fact"

$$
P(F|E) = \frac{P(E|F)P(F)}{P(E)} \\
P(E|F) = 20\%\\
P(F) = 60\%\\
\text{Using Total Probability:}\\
P(E) = P(E|F)P(F)+P(E|F')P(F')\\
=0.2\times0.6 + 0.01\times0.04 = 0.324\\
\text{Then apply Bayes Theorem}
$$

### Question:

A test is 98% effective at detecting a disease ("true positive"). However, the test has a "false positive" rate of 1%. 0.5% of the US population has the disease. What is the likelihood you have the disease, if you test positive.

#### Answer:

$$
\text{Events are}\\
\text{E: you test positive}\\
\text{F: you have the disease}\\
\text{To find: P(F|E)}\\
\\
P(E|F) = 98\%\\
P(E|F') = 1\%\\
P(E'|F) = 1-P(E|F) = 2\%\\
P(E'|F') = 1-P(E|F') = 99\%
\\
\text{Using Bayes Theorem:}\\
P(F|E) = \frac{P(E|F)P(F)}{P(E)} \\
= \frac{P(E|F)P(F)}{P(E|F)P(F)+P(E|F')P(F')} \\
= \frac{0.98\times0.005}{0.98\times0.005+0.01 \times0.995}
$$

## Monty Hall Problem

* In a game show there are three doors
* Behind one of the doors, there is a car and in the other two there are goats
* Pick one door and then the host opens another door that definitely has a goat behind it.
* You are given a choice to pick the other unopened door or the door you picked originally
* **Question:** Is it probabilistically wise to change doors.

It seems like a 50% chance after the host reveals 1 goat, since you either stay or change to get either a car or a goat.

The correct strategy is to switch. We have a 66% of picking a goat door first, thus making the switch give you a car since the host will reveal the other goat door.

The choices and probabilities to win can be represented with a choice tree:

### Proof using Bayes Theorem

Let H be the event that "door 1 has a car behind it" and E be that "a goat was revealed"

P(H|E) will answer the problem.
$$
P(H) = 1/3\\
P(H') = 1-1/3 = 2/3\\
P(E|H)= P(\text{a goat was revealed given that door 1 has a car behind it})\\
=1\\
P(E|H') = \text{also 1 since a goat door is always revealed}\\
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}\\
 = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H)+P(E|H')P(H')}\\
 = \frac{1\times 1/3}{1\times1/3+1\times2/3} = \frac{1}{3}
$$
