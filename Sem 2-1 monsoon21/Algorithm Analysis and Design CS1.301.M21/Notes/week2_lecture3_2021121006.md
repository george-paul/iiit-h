# Week 2, Lecture 3 on 25 August 2021 CS1.301.M21 Algorithm Analysis and Design

***

So far we have dealt with both solvable and unsolvable problems.
Henceforth for a while we will deal with only *tractable* problems.

## Fibonacci Numbers

$$
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55
$$

Fibonacci number $n$ is calculated using:
$$
F_N = F_{N-1} + F_{N-2}
$$
The problem: **WAP to take $N$ and give $F_N$**

> We must ask ourselves some questions about every algorithm:

> *  is the algorithm correct?
> * Will that take finite time? How much time?
> * Can we do better?

### Recursion Algorithm

```c
int fib1(int n)
{
	if(n == 0) 
        return 0;
	if(n == 1) 
        return 1;
	return fib1(n-1) + fib1(n-2);
}
```

The correctness of the algorithm is obvious since it follow directly from the definition of $F_N$

Since `fib1(n)` could be called multiple times for a single `n`, the number of recursions increases exponentially.

Can we do better? Yes.

### Memoisation Algorithm

Recursion is done, but whenever a value for `fib2(n)` is calculated, store it in an array at index `n` and whenever `fib2(n)` is needed give the stored value.

```c
int fib2(n)
{
	if(n==0) return 0;
	//create array f[0...n]
	f[0]=0; f[1]=1;
	for(int i =2; i<=n; i++)
	{
		f[i]=f[i-1]+f[i-2];
	}
	return f[n];
}
```

 Correctness can be proved in the same way as the recursive algorithm.

Since the [bits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5248219/about-number-of-bits-required-for-fibonacci-number) in $F_N \approx 0.694n$, the addition step in line 8 actually takes $O(n)$. So the overall complexity is $O(n^2)$.

### Using Matrix multiplication

It is known that:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
F_n\\
F_{n+1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
^n
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
F_0\\
F_1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
This leads to a complexity of $O(M(n)\text{log} \; n)$ where $M(n)$ is the complexity of multiplying matrices.

### Using the recurrence relation formula

It is [known that](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinetsFibonacciNumberFormula.html):
$$
F_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[
\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n - 
\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n\right]
$$
But accuracy issues arise with larger values since, memory limitations mean that irrational numbers can only be stored with limited accuracy.

**Thus an $O(n \; \text{log}^2 \; n)$ algorithm exists to compute Fibonacci numbers. Any further optimization is unknown.**

## Multiplying large integers

### The Traditional Method

Two n-digit numbers $a$ and $b$ will need up to $n^2$ single digit multiplications, additions and shifts.

This algorithm will be $O(n^2)$

### Karatsuba Algorithm

>  [link](https://brilliant.org/wiki/karatsuba-algorithm/) that helped

<a name="complex">-</a>Multiplying two complex numbers: 
$$
(a+ib)(c+id) = (ac - bd) + i(ad+bc)
$$
This operation naively takes four multiplications namely: $ac, bd, ad, bc$

Instead we can:

* Compute $ac$
* Compute $bd$
* Compute $(a + b)(c + d)$

and then obtain $(ad + bc) = (a + b)(c + d) − ac − bd$

So two multiply two n-bit integers $x$ and $y$, partition each of them into parts that contain $n/2$ of the bits each i.e.
$$
x = 2^{n/2}a + b\\
y = 2^{n/2}c + d\\
\therefore \; x\cdot y = (2^{n/2}a + b) \cdot (2^{n/2}c + d)
$$
Which is similar to the [above](#complex) method of computing complex products but instead of $i$ we have $2^{n/2}$.

Using the Master Theorem (from the next lecture), we can glean the Karatsuba Algorithm's time complexity to be $O(n^{1.585})$

> The Fast Fourier transform and faster options exist with the best known yet to be $O(n\;\text{log}n)$
