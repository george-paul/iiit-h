## Review

* *Minimum spanning tree* problem showed the overarching method of writing greedy algorithms. 
* Find a local property that gives a local answer
* Use induction to extend it into a global solution
* With the *activity selection* problem, we selected the activity with the least finish time and that gave a local optimum since it will always be a part of the final solution
* Huffman codes also were examined

##  Set Cover problem

**Input**: A set of elements $B$; and sets $S_1,...S_m \sube B$

**Output**: A selection of the $S_i$ sets whose union is $B$. 

**Cost**: Minimize the Number of sets picked

### Example

Consider

to cover the set $B =$

> Set cover problem is a problem that pops up in many places, it is often the underlying sub problem in many other problems.

> If you solve set cover, we can also solve other problems like *protein folding*.

### A possible greedy algorithm

```
Repeat until all elements of B are covered:
	Pick the set S[i] with the highest number of elements that are yet to be covered.
```

First $S_i$ selected will be of the set with the highest cardinality i.e. in our case $\text{thread}$

> note that in our case, we are using words that can have repeated elements, but sets normally will not have non-unique elements

Then subsequently follow the algorithm.

### Analyzing the example

$\text{shun}$ is a must pick since it is the only set with $u$.

### Counter-Example

Suppose $B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$

![image-20210915112311106](C:\Users\gpaul\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210915112311106.png)

So, the question remains whether the greedy solution compares to the optimum solution

It has been shown that *set cover* is NP complete.

### Greedy sol is O(ln n)

**Claim**: Suppose $|B|=n$ and the optimal cover has $k$ sets. Then the greedy algorithm will use at most $k \ln{n}$ sets.

**Proof:**

Let $n_t$ be the number of uncovered elements after $t$ iterations

So $n_0 = n, n_1 <n, ...$

Our greedy algorithm stops at iteration $t$ when $n_t <1$

Some sets of the $k$ sets can cover all of the $n_t$ elements (since they cover all the elements in fact). And by the Pigeonhole Principle, we can say that there is one of the $k$ sets that cover at least $\frac{n_t}{k}$ of the $n_t$ elements.

So,
$$
n_{t+1} \leq n_t - \frac{n_t}{k} = n_t(1-\frac{1}{k})\\
\therefore n_t \leq n_0(1-\frac{1}{k})^t\\
\text{it is known that,} 1-x \leq e^{-x} \text{ equal only if }x =0\\
n_0(1-\frac{1}{k})^t \lt n_0(e^{-1/k})^t = ne^{-t/k}\\
\text{at } t= k\ln n, n_t<ne^{-\ln n} = 1
$$

> here greedy algorithm isn't always optimal, but we actually have a bound on the cost of the solution of the greedy algorithm, so it becomes better than whatever heuristic we can come up with
