## Edit Distance

### Problem

Possible operations that count as an edit: Insert, Delete or Overwrite.
The Edit Distance between two strings is the minimal number of operations required to convert one string to the other.

One intuitive way of measuring the edit distance is by observing how many characters in each string match up or *align* after adding some blanks in the words.
And so the edit distance will be the number of columns that are mismatched in the alignment with least possible mismatches.

Eg.

Here, a blank-char mismatch is an insert, a char-blank mismatch is a delete and a char-char mismatch is an overwrite.

This example can be aligned with less mismatches as shown:

### Answer

We can use dynamic programming to solve this.
**So what are the subproblems?**

The goal being to find the edit distance between the strings $x[1 ... m]$ and $y[1 ...n]$

Suppose a subproblem $E(i,j)$ as the edit distance between certain prefixes of $x$ and $y$ ending in $i$ and $j$.

**An observation:**
The rightmost column can only be one of the following:
![image-20210922105803168](C:\Users\gpaul\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210922105803168.png) 

So we can recursively define $E(i,j)$ as
$$
E(i,j) = \min\{1+E(i-1,j), 1+E(i,j-1), \text{diff}(i,j)+E(i-1,j-1)\}
$$

> $\text{diff}(i,j)$ is 0 if the characters are equal and 1 otherwise

The DP table is:

So to find the final answer we recursively find the answers for the subproblems.

Now the question becomes: In what order do we solve the subproblems?

We know that the entire column and row of $[0,j]$ and $[i,0]$ are $i$ and $j$. So we can start at $[1,1]$ and solve row-wise or column-wise till the final answer. The DP table becomes:

![image-20210922111023981](C:\Users\gpaul\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210922111023981.png)

The algorithm then is:

An example DAG for `POLYNOMIAL` and `EXPONENTIAL` is:

![image-20210922112210949](C:\Users\gpaul\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210922112210949.png)

So in total the cost of the algorithm is $O(mn)$
