Every DAG will have a topological sorting order as follows:

It can be shown that every DAG has a topological sorting order since a DAG always has a source. If the source is removed then the remaining nodes form a DAG themselves with another different source node, and this continues inductively.

**Problem**: For all non-source nodes calculate the shortest distance from the source node to that node.

### Solution

```
intialize dist(all nodes) to \inf
dist(s) = 0
for all nodes v in V-{s}:		//non-source nodes
	dist(v) = minimum of {dist(u) + l(u,v)} for all u's that are in-neighbors of v
```

## Longest Paths in DAGs

Instead of book-keeping the minimum of the values `{dist(u) + l(u,v)}`

But to find the longest paths in non-DAGs this isn't possible. The possibility of a cycle means that the answer for a longest path would be meaningless.

## Longest Increasing SUbsequence

### Problem

The input is a sequence of of numbers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$

A subsequence is $a_{i_{1}},a_{i_{2}},...,a_{i_{k}}$ such that $1 \leq i_1 \leq i_2 \leq ...\leq i_k$. An increasing subsequence is one where the $a$ values are increasing.

For example,

### Answer

Create a DAG of all permissible transitions. If a node $i$ exists for each $a_i$ then an edge $(i,j)$ exists if $i<j$ and $a_i<a_j$ i.e. if $a_i$ can come before $a_j$ in an increasing subsequence.

$L(j)$ is the length of the longest path ending at a node $j$. In other word, it is the LIS ending at $j$.

Therefore the LIS of the given sequence is the maximal value of $L(j)+1$ for all $j$ 

> In general, the dynamic programming paradigm is used when there are subproblems that depend on the answers of other subproblems. 

All in all the algorithm is:

```
for all j:
	L(j) = 1+ max{L(i):fot all (i,j)}
return max L(j)
```
