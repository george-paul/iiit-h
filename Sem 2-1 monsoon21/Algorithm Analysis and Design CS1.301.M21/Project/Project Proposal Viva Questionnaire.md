# Algorithm Analysis and Design - Project Proposal Viva Questionnaire

*- George Paul (2021121006)*



## Question 1 - Driving Force

**Algorithms for Humans** - A blog that tries its best to inform the general population about the presence and intricacies behind the algorithms that help run the world and push the cutting edge of computer science. Complete with sensationalized internet titles and clickbait, the articles also try to incite a desire to learn more about the subject and help people pursue more knowledge and progress in the field of algorithms.

My driving force behind this project is my passion towards teaching and communication of my passion to others. Whenever I am with my family, friends or peers, I'm always interested in pointing out anything that relates to computers and computer science and continue to explain it. For example the other day, I managed to speak to my family about shortest path algorithms when the topic of GPS map applications came up.

I feel I possess a certain level of sympathy and perspective when interacting with other people which is especially useful when teaching. As a result of this, I would say a particular talent of mine is, when tutoring, knowing exactly what the gap in knowledge of the pupil is. Building on this is understanding why the general public seems to think theoretical computer science is unapproachable and thus attacking that in particular.



## Question 2 - Evaluation

The main goal of my project is to make algorithms and other computer science topics accessible to the general public. Hence the level at which I end up accomplishing that is a good aspect upon which to evaluate my end result. I don't intend to be a comprehensive learning resource but instead intend to spark curiosity and a thirst for knowledge into these topics.



## Question 3 - Feedback

Feedback was minimal, I received many tips and other methods by which I can make project better and reach more people such as by citing my article in Wikipedia edits. The most pertinent feedback I received was about the title which is "Algorithms for Humans". It seems there it is a little open to interpretation as to what it means which I intended to be "Algorithms (made simple) for Humans" but instead it could be interpreted as "Algorithms for Humans (that can be used and executed by humans for various tasks)". I don't think the name will be changed though since the name doesn't actually appear anywhere outside of my proposal and I'm still quite fond of it.
