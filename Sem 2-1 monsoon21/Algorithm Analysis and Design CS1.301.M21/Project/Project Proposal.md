# CS1.301.M21 Algorithms Analysis and Design, Project Proposal

>  by George Paul (Roll no: 2021121006)

Having been a long time fan of algorithms and hence a fan of people who teach me algorithms, I'm compelled to have my project communicate the wonder and also the technicality of algorithms to a non-computer-scientist population. **Presenting**:

## Algorithms for Humans

A blog that tries its best to inform the general population about the presence and intricacies behind the algorithms that help run the world and push the cutting edge of computer science. Complete with sensationalized internet titles and clickbait, the articles also try to incite a desire to learn more about the subject and help people pursue more knowledge and progress in the field of algorithms.

### Timeline

The approximate timeline for the project is until the end of the course. The current estimate is ~10 articles that will be released intermittently until the end of the semester.

### Sample

A sample of the first article in the project is given below:
