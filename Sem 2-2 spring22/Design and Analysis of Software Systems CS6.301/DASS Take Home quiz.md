<div align="right"><b> by George Paul (2021121006)</b></div>





## General Questions

**Q1**: List the 6 stages of Requirements process.

**Ans1**:
The six stages of the Requirements Process are:

1. Gathering of Project Requirements
2. Requirement Analysis
3. Prototype and Mock Creation
4. Customer Review
5. Writing up Specifications for the Project
6. Implementation and Testing



**Q2**: List the 3 types of requirements and explain about each.

**Ans2**:
The three types of requirements are:

* *Business Requirements* - High level objectives that the project seeks to accomplish, very often specified by the customer.
* *Functional Requirements* - A definitive description of what the software should be able to do and the various use cases under which it can be utilized.
* *Non-functional Requirements* - Usually these are constraints under which the software must operate. Things like quality assurance, memory limits, minimum performance etc.



**Q3**: State the quality requirements needed for a project.

**Ans3**:
The quality requirements needed for a project are:

* *Correctness* - The product should behave as intended and this can only be verified by a user representative
* *Feasible* - Check whether the requirements are practically achievable given the constraints.
* *Necessary* - Reflect upon whether every need is, in fact, necessary by following the train of thought on where it came from.
* *Unambiguous* - The Project can only be interpreted in one way. Any discrepancies between the the customer and the developers will lead to mistakes.
* *Verifiable* - Whether the final software be verified to behave in the intended way.
* *Prioritized* - The value provided to the customer must be high as a result of the effort put into the project.



**Q4**: What are some common reasons for failure of a project?

**Ans4**:
Some common reasons for the failure of a project are:

* Lack of User Input
* Incomplete Requirements & Specifications 
* Changing Requirements & Specifications
* Lack of Resources
* Unrealistic Expectations
* Unclear Objectives
* Unrealistic Time Frames



**Q5**: Explain the importance of scope while studying and requirements.

**Ans5**: 
The scope of a project and its subproblems describe the category or an umbrella, one could say, under which the requirements problems can be grouped. The scope of a problem is important to understand as the problems under the same scope can, and often should, be worked on at the same time since they would have interweaving elements and interactions. If the assigned scope is too broad then it becomes difficult to focus on things individually and slows down the development process as it becomes necessary to look at many of the problems under the scope when trying to make progress. On the other hand, if the scope is too narrow then it turns out that the big picture, which is diligent to keep in mind, is hardly noticed and we find the high level goals leaving the attention of the team.



**Q6**: What is an incomplete and what is an inconsistent requirement? Give example for each.

**Ans6**: 

* An *incomplete requirement* is one that supplies insufficient information to glean enough to develop upon. Maybe certain details or a point as a whole could have been omitted due to human error. 
  Eg. In a todo list app where tasks can be added and ticked, the customer could have not mentioned that it is imperative that users be able to reorder the tasks as well
* An *inconsistent requirement* is one that contradicts with another or itself. It is often discovered later in the project and usually originates as a result of discrepancies in the clients views.
  Eg. One requirement might specify that the todo list app needs to be sorted due date, while another might specify that the list needs to sorted according the date the task was added.



**Q7**: What are the goals of requirements phase?

**Ans7**: 
The goals of requirements phase are:

* To fully understand the requirements put forward by the user and comprehend what the user desires in the software.
* To make clear exactly what is required by removing the possibility of any inconsistencies and anomalies during the listing of requirements.
* To document the process and requirements in a consistent manner in an SRS doc designed for future referral and checking.



**Q8**: Give 5 examples of bad requirements.

**Ans8**: 
Some examples of bad requirements are:

* "The software should be fast"
* "It should be something like [X other app on the market]"
* "The product must work on all devices"
* "There must be no glitches"
* "None of the users should have difficulty when using the app"



**Q9**: List at least 5 techniques involved in Requirements Gathering and Analysis.

**Ans9**:
Some techniques that can help with requirements gathering are:

* Pre made documents regarding the client's high level business goals can be examined.
* Recording meetings with the customers and clients when discussing the requirements.
* Interviewing the client about various details regarding the software - their vision, ideas, any images they can provide, value provided and possible uses.
* Bouncing ideas and thoughts off of each other as a form of brainstorming in which the client and the developer can arrive at a mutual understanding of the way the software will be developed.
* Interviewing and shadowing potential users and observing possible problems and being on the look out for potential ideas that could improve the end user experience.



**Q10**: What are some difficulties and risks associated with requirements analysis?

**Ans10**: 
Some hindrances and difficulties in the area of requirements analysis are:

* Promising and intending to do more than can be done in the development phase given the time and personnel constraints.
* The client and/or developer can have a minimal amount of experience and understanding in that particular domain, leading to a sub par product
* In the technology world, the requirements can change rapidly as new technologies and new possibilities are uncovered. The team must be ready and adaptable.
* When so much data is gathered regarding the requirements and the vision for the software system, there can be discrepancies between, say the client's vision and the investigation undertaken by the team.
* The requirements might so vast for a large project that they could be difficult to break down and list simply and without compromising on the quality of the SRS doc, it's clarity and brevity.





## Specific Questions

**Q1**: What are your deliverables?

**Ans1**: The deliverables for this project are a single android app and an accompanying dashboard for the client.



**Q2**: State the scope of your project.

**Ans2**: Due towards the end of April, the scope of the project is to provide the user with the ability to book gas cylinders from Vijayshankar Gas Agency for delivery to their homes/places of business.



**Q3**: List your project's functional requirements.

**Ans3**:

* The app must provide an easy to use, operational graphical interface to book cylinders for delivery.
* The app must authenticate users with their phone number and One Time Password and/or normal password.
* The software must keep track of the user's addresses and give the option to change addresses for each order.
* The app should predict possible dates for the next order for a user so that the company can accordingly market.
* A dashboard should be provided for the company to keep a track of orders and for deliverymen who will take up orders for delivery.



**Q4**: List your project's non-functional requirements.

**Ans4**:

* The app should be available on the Android Operating System.
* The app must perform reliably and as such have robust mechanisms to protect against failures.



**Q5**: List your project's business requirements.

**Ans5**: 

* The app is intended to bring in more customers for the company.
* Another avenue for customers to book cylinders is provided so as to give customers of the company more options.
* The predictive analysis of the past bookings can help the company marketing push more cylinders to the users and in a more timely fashion.
* The app can help coordinate deliveries among the deliverymen, ensuring that deliveries don't get taken up by two agents at a time.
