**Created By: **George Paul, Amal Sunny, Anantha Shayana Reddy, Gaddam Vinay Chandra (Team 47)
**Client**: Mr. Niman Goli, Vijayshankar Gas Agency

### Description

The client, Mr. Niman Goli, is in charge of an LPG distribution agency and is currently in need of an application through which customers can book LPG gas cylinders for delivery at their locations. Also, by extension, a tool meant for the distribution agency's deliverymen needs to be developed as well to coordinate and ensure the deliveries of the cylinders.

### Profile of Users

The users almost exclusively consist of customers of the agency who are in need of gas cylinders. Such as families, kitchen managers, restaurants, hotels etc. Thus the app will entertain near computer-illiterate individuals and feature a simplistic, user-friendly interface.

### Feature Highlights

* **User Authentication**: Users will be logged in with a password and/or One Time Password that will arrive at their phone numbers. 
* **Cylinder booking**: With minimal interaction, a customer can book a cylinder through the application that will arrive as soon as possible to a saved address. Saved addresses can be added at any time.
* **Booking History**: The user can view their booking history through the app. The company can also view the booking records of a particular customer on demand.
* **Predictive Analysis**: Based on previous booking trends of customers, the app can extrapolate, through simple means, an approximate date for the customer's next booking so that the company can market accordingly via notifications, phone calls etc.
* **Utility Notifications**: User will receive notifications when a cylinder booking is confirmed and when a cylinder is delivered.
