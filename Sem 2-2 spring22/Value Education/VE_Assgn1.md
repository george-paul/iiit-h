# Value Education II - Assignment 1 To Kill A Mockingbird Review

<div align ='right'><b> By George Paul (2021121006)</b></div>



To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic from Harper Lee written in 1960 that tells the story of many people via the eyes of Scout, a member of the Finch family who along with others is fascinated with the neighbor Boo Radley due to his mysteriousness. They later find out the man he truly is. Most of the book concerns the judicial system and its role especially its fairness to colored people when a young black man is accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch, the father of Scout is assigned to defend the young man and stands by his side despite being hated for it in early racial tension-filled America. The book exhibits many of the issues that filled America, and indeed the world at that time. It talks about the expectations placed on women to be "beautiful and feminine" and on the poor and shunned introverts who are often seen as enemies. Atticus Finch is a fitting "hero" to the story that is a righteous and non-prejudicial character that carries the weight of the world on his back as he navigates the stubborn mule of early America. Scout gives a fresh set of eyes on the events of the story that can be placed as a wonderful, honest take on society as we know it. The book features many characters that can placed in society as the typical suspects and victims of many issues in the world. All in all the book remains a classic that brings to light many of these issues in a story through the eyes of a young woman who knows not the worlds prejudices but the worlds realities and forms her own opinions.
