<div align ='right'><b> By George Paul (2021121006)</b></div>



## Nurturing Mental Health (Season 3 Episode 5)

This episode of Satymev Jayate shows us about the status quo regarding mental health and its awareness in this country. As with any kind of health, mental health requires the same kind of attention, care and resources yet it is often met with dismissal and set aside as a farce. Deterioration of physical health being so obvious with symptoms that manifest very obviously like pains, coughs and such gets the attention it needs but despite the fact that suicides are the second highest cause of death it receives none of that. The reality of this situation is brought to light with the first two guests of this episode. The first is Ms. Veena Ail who testifies to the experience of losing her daughter by suicide. She speaks of possible bullying/teasing that her daughter, Shweta, experienced as a result of her TB affliction. She talks about her diary and such, despite being so close to each other there are things that Ms. Ail didn't know about her daughter. Her daughter was found hanging after 19 years of her life.
Following her statement, Khan brings to the dais Dr. Harish Shetty, a psychologist who speaks about the necessity of a professional in the treatment of mental illness. The unnecessary and inexcusable shame society places on seeing a psychologist needs to be amended in our country. There needs to be only as much difficulty in seeing a, say, dermatologist, as is seeing a mental health expert. As Dr. Shetty says, there are certain things, just as in physical health, that only a professional can spot and crucially only a professional can treat.

Later on, we get to hear from two suicide survivors who share their stories and are living examples of the both the dangers and preventability of mental illness. Our country needs a dramatic shift in thinking that can only be brought about by the normalization of these issues and open, honest conversation with and around mental illness and its victims.



## Break The Silence (Season 1 Episode 2)

Child Sexual Abuse, and in fact sexual abuse as a whole, is an event that happens much too often in our country. The predators and sick people who engage in such acts with the most unknowing and innocent of our world are a plague on the world and our children, frankly, need to be aware of such things. This episode  of Satyamev Jayate brings to light the actions, consequences and solutions to the abnormally high pedophilic tendencies of certain people in India.

Aamir Khan showcases the story of a sexual abuse survivor, and especially on the fact that the ones whom we may never think are the ones who are more prone to such actions. Anamika tells the story of how her tutor who was almost universally liked sexually abused her as a child. The story really speaks to the safety, or lack thereof, of children even in the places that we may consider are safest. 

Even though the general conception of this issue is that these things only happen to girl children, a sizeable portion, in fact upto 53% of child sexual abuse cases involve boys. To highlight this, we hear the story of Harish Iyer who fell victim to this atrocious act at the age of 6 and once again at the hands of a fairly trustworthy individual.
The stigma surround child sexual abuse is one that needs to be brought down so that conversations like the ones on this show can be had. It is important that we educate the public about where these acts tend to happen and who tend to engage in them. The show ends with a class for children regarding "danger zones" that no one should touch. An important lesson that children can use to protect themselves at the forefront.

## Persons with Disabilites (Season 1 Episode 6)

The main focus of this episode of Satyamev Jayate is the difficulties and challenges faced by the people in our country who are disabled. The host, Aamir Khan, brings onto the show various guests and testimonies that demonstrate to the audience the severe lack of infrastructure and support that such people face.
Krishnakant Mane is a man who lives with paraplegia, a kind of affliction that removes one's ability to move the lower half of the body. He speaks of his experiences having been, effectively, born into such a condition, and especially about the lack of features in our country that could help him lead a better life. But the main lesson we learn from Mr. Mane is that despite being set back by so much in his life he never let his dreams and the challenges he set for himself be of "that of a disabled person", in that they were never set back like he was. He continued to live the life of a normal man albeit through different means and methods throughout his life from travelling to and from school and leaving home to live alone for his work. An inspiration to those of us who struggle to face the challenges in our life that are far from as inconvenient as the ones that Krishnakant Mane faces.

One more among the guests on the show is Mr. Kothari who is a champion of inclusivity and awareness for the disabled. he is himself blind and speaks about how the public perceive those with disabilities. Sure, they might be different but the takeaway shouldn't be that they are different. They are all of course humans who go about their lives with the same wants and desires and mindsets. Kothari speaks of how the disabled are either praised and pampered or are hated and shunned. They wish for neither of these extremes but to be seen as normal people. They are "proud of being [disabled]" and are only asking for a platform the same as anyone else.

Khan continues to bring to forefront many other people to speak about their experiences and views as/about the disabled and ends the show with a performance from "Ability Unlimited" a troupe comprised of disabled persons.
