# Introduction to Brain and Cognition - Assignment 1

### Question 1

Eric Kandel points out one of the most defining features of autism with the given diagram. He says that when autism patients interact with other humans they often don't look into the eyes of the person they're interacting with. This behaviour is usually a very social action but its absence in autistic persons say something about the effect it has on the brain.
The diagram in particular is a map of the places a normal and an autistic person look at when looking at this particular image of a blond woman.  

### Question 2

The blue region, called the superior temporal sulcus, performs this function.

### Question 3

The phenomenon known as culture is present only in the human species. This is because humans are the only animals on Earth capable of imitation. Mirror neurons are the cells behind our tendency towards imitation. Seeing actions such as picking up and putting down objects are ones that trigger mirror neurons and in the same place in the brain as when we ourselves do these actions. Learning and other imitation related activities can often be attributed to mirror neurons.

### Question 4

The main pull of mirror neurons is that when perceiving sensory information about some action, the brain's areas that are used to execute that motor function are also active. This enables humans to imitate very well because this information cannot be substituted with any kind of cognitive/inferential observation since we are using that same part of the brain as we would if we were doing it ourselves. 

### Question 5

Common cardinal, observable symptoms of autism are: 

* Autism patients tend to socially interact in an unorthodox manner and maybe even are quite withdrawn from socialising.
* Repetitive behavior and movements such as certain hand motions and patting.
* The language they use is often irregular and uncommon compared to non-patients.

### Question 6

In her study of the social behaviors of worms, Cornelia Bargmann noticed that certain worms tend to be with other worms more. The movie she shows highlights one or two of the more social worms and it is obvious that these worms like to be together more than the others. They exhibit this behaviour for a few reasons:

* Sometimes even certain sexes tend to collaborate more often.
* Depending on the season and time, one might find that during mating/spawning seasons animals are together more.
* The environment becomes more hospitable when they're together as they work together to _make_ it more hospitable.
*  Also importantly, these worms that have certain genes that exhibit high levels of activity also exhibit high levels of social behaviour and vice versa. The gene in particular that we examine here is neuro-peptide receptor called MPR-1 which dictates in certain ways how scattered, far away neurons communicate in the brain.
