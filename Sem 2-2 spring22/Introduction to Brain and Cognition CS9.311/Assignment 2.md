### Question 1

The interviewer and Dr. McGaugh both ask the subjects possessing HSAM about various events in their lives, which should be recollected almost definitely from the episodic memory. Also questions about trivia, information on public events and sports matches and the like were asked. These questions would require recollection from the the semantic memory of normal individuals but what ends up happening with those with HSAM is that they remember the moment at which they learned this information - something like "Oh, I was here doing this when John Lennon was assassinated". They seem to be recollecting this semantic information with the help of their superior episodic memory. 

### Question 2

Most of the subjects with HSAM like to "exercise" their memory in a way. Louise Owen, for example, likes to play certain games with herself and ask herself certain questions that stretch the extent of her memory. She asks herself questions like "What is the most memorable August 8th of my life?" and she then promptly goes through all of the days that match the description to answer the question satisfactorily. 

The HSAM possessors also display certain behavioural patterns that match, to a minor extent, the behaviour displayed by those affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder - examples include the need to organise wardrobes and compulsive washing of hands. They say that the memories are organised in their head almost similarly to real-life objects on shelves or the like and hence they have these tendencies.

### Question 3

Copying this behaviour won't do much to help get memory that is at any level even close to those with HSAM. But it will do well for one's memory to, once in a while, do such "exercises" where one tries to recall events and thus strengthen the neuron connections and thus the memory, enabling better recollection on that memory in the future.

### Question 4

The caudate nucleus is a part of the basal ganglia that lies at the centre of the brain. The main function of the caudate nucleus is to aid in motor function. Namely the  accuracy and speed of movements of the limbs. Research has also shown that it has functions to do with memory and learning as well, which is of interest to those of us studying the subjects that possess HSAMs. The caudate nucleus is known to be linked with the systems that deal with working memory. 

As an initial hypothesis, it could be possible that the enlarged caudate nucleus enables an increase in the capacity and efficiency of working memory and in turn and increase in the episodes and details committed to the short term and long term memory.

### Question 5

The main benefit is that the near perfect episodic memory leads to an almost perfect recollection of public events and facts, not due to an increased semantic memory capacity but because the HSAM enables the subjects to remember the moment they learned the semantic information.

An easily accessed, effective "movie" of one's life has its benefits for those who have lived a life that have mostly good memories. Marilu Henner is one of the subjects that possess an HSAM and has lived a mostly fortunate life and she remains thankful to have HSAM.

### Question 6

The main detrimental ways in which the subjects' lives are affected are similar to the beneficial ways. Just like those who have lived good lives until now love remembering all the good times, those with relatively unfortunate circumstances and thus worse memories are adversely affected by being able to have total recall over all those bad memories. This tends to have a psychological effect on these people. Jill Price testifies that she'd rather not have had this ability and wonders what her life would have been like if she had been born like any other person with a normal memory.

Another possible detrimental effect could be a constant bombardment of information in one's consciousness. Although it might seem obvious that this is the case being in possession of so much near-perfect episodic memory, it doesn't seem to be the case as the subjects claim that the memories only show when summoned and are effectively "organised and stored away" neatly in their brains.
